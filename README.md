## Implementation Notes

**TL;DR**  
A minimal yet thoughtful task tracker with inline editing, local persistence, and careful UX. I prioritized clear structure, predictable state, and resilient layout/datepicker handling over piling on features.

### Goals
- Keep the domain model simple and explicit.
- Deliver a pleasant UX (inline edit, sane validation, responsive layout).
- Avoid common pitfalls (timezone drift for dates, long-title layout blowups).

### Architecture
- **Module `modules/tasks`**
  - `model/` ‚Äî types + a small repository over `localStorage` (pure functions).
  - `hooks/` ‚Äî `useTasks` as a React adapter (state/effects, stable callbacks).
  - `ui/` ‚Äî `TaskCard` (inline edit), `TaskForm` (create), `TasksSection` (facade).
- **Page** ‚Äî thin composition (`<TasksSection />`), no business logic.

### Data & Persistence
- `Task` = `{ id, title, description?, isComplete, priority?, dueDate?, createdAt, updatedAt }`.
- IDs: `Date.now() + counter` ‚Äî simple and sufficient for local storage.
- Dates stored as `YYYY-MM-DD` (not ISO strings) to avoid UTC shifts; parsed to local midnight for UI.

### Key Decisions
- **Inline editing** in `TaskCard` with a local draft; `Esc` = cancel, `‚åò/Ctrl+Enter` = save.
- **Validation**: title ‚â§ 100, description ‚â§ 500; counters + disabled submit + subtle error state.
- **Due date**: shadcn popover + calendar; date badge near the title; overdue = red badge + small callout.
- **Layout resilience**: grid `minmax(0,1fr)_auto`, `min-w-0`, `truncate/line-clamp`, and safe word wrapping so very long titles don‚Äôt break cards.
- **Performance hygiene**: stable callbacks (`useCallback`), `React.memo` where it actually helps.

### Lyrical Aside
There‚Äôs a line I like about our craft: **‚Äúwe don‚Äôt finish projects, we abandon them.‚Äù**  
I invested about **8 hours** into this. Not because the scope was huge, but because I tend to build things **deliberately**: clean types, small pure layers, and UX that feels considered. The context was also atypical for me ‚Äî the last ~3 years I mostly worked without TypeScript and Tailwind, on codebases with lots of reusable pieces and settled architecture. Getting back into TS/Tailwind cost me about **an hour** just to re-groove the fundamentals.  
I‚Äôm happy with the current result as an MVP; there‚Äôs plenty I could push further, and I list that below.

### Trade-offs
- Skipped form libraries (RHF/Zod) and DnD/filtering to keep the MVP tight and the code readable.
- Kept persistence to `localStorage` with a versioned key; easy to swap out the repo later.
- Focused on inline edit + validation + date UX instead of breadth of features.

### What I‚Äôd Do Next (with more time)
- Filters (All / Active / Completed, Overdue) and sorting (dueDate/priority/updatedAt).
- Import/export JSON; storage migrations.
- Tests: unit tests for the repo; a tiny e2e happy path.
- Expanded a11y (aria roles/labels, full keyboard coverage) and theming/i18n.

### Lessons Learned / Reaffirmed
- Storing dates as `YYYY-MM-DD` + parsing to **local** midnight eliminates the ‚Äúminus one day‚Äù trap.
- In flexible layouts, `min-w-0` and `minmax(0,1fr)` are must-haves to stop long tokens from blowing up cards.
- ‚ÄúSkeleton first, then polish‚Äù consistently beats trying to perfect everything at once.

# 60-Minute Front-End Developer Test

## Overview
Welcome to our front-end developer assessment! This test is designed to evaluate your React, TypeScript, and CSS skills within a 60-minute timeframe.

## Test Format: Q&A Style Completion

### Question 1: Project Setup & Understanding (5 minutes)
**Q: What technologies are used in this project?**
**A: Expected Response:** React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components

**Q: How do you start the development server?**
**A: Expected Response:** `npm run dev` or `npm start`

### Question 2: Component Creation (15 minutes)
**Q: Create a `TaskCard` component that displays:**
- Task title
- Task description  
- Priority level (High, Medium, Low) with color coding
- Completion status
- Due date
- Delete and Edit buttons

**A: Requirements:**
- Use TypeScript with proper interfaces
- Apply appropriate styling using the design system
- Make it responsive
- Handle click events for edit/delete buttons

### Question 3: State Management (10 minutes)
**Q: Implement state management for the task list:**
- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
- Delete tasks
- Edit existing tasks

**A: Requirements:**
- Use React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Implement proper TypeScript types
- Persist data to localStorage
- Handle edge cases (empty states, validation)

### Question 4: Form Implementation (15 minutes)
**Q: Create a task form with validation:**
- Title (required, max 100 characters)
- Description (optional, max 500 characters)
- Priority dropdown (High, Medium, Low)
- Due date picker
- Form validation with error messages

**A: Requirements:**
- Use controlled components
- Implement form validation
- Show error states
- Clear form after submission
- Use proper TypeScript types

### Question 5: Styling & UX (10 minutes)
**Q: Enhance the UI with:**
- Smooth animations/transitions
- Loading states
- Empty state when no tasks
- Responsive design for mobile
- Hover effects and micro-interactions

**A: Requirements:**
- Use Tailwind CSS classes
- Follow the existing design system
- Ensure accessibility (proper ARIA labels)
- Smooth user experience

### Question 6: Advanced Features (5 minutes)
**Q: Add ONE of the following features:**
- Search functionality to filter tasks
- Sort tasks by priority or due date
- Drag and drop to reorder tasks
- Export tasks to JSON

**A: Choose based on your strengths and time remaining**

## Evaluation Criteria

### Code Quality (30%)
- Clean, readable code
- Proper TypeScript usage
- Component structure and reusability
- Error handling

### Functionality (25%)

- Consistent styling
- Good user experience
- Accessibility considerations

### Problem Solving (20%)
- Approach to complex features

## Starter Code
The project includes:
- ‚úÖ Basic project setup with React, TypeScript, Tailwind
- ‚úÖ Design system and component library (shadcn/ui)
- ‚úÖ Routing setup

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Open `http://localhost:8080`

## Submission Guidelines
- Complete as many questions as possible within 60 minutes
- Commit your code frequently
- Add comments explaining complex logic
- If you run out of time, document what you would implement next

## Time Management Tips
- Spend 5 minutes planning your approach

- Using React Hook Form for advanced form handling
- Implementing custom hooks for reusable logic

Good luck! üöÄ
